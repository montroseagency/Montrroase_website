=== LOGIN 400 ERROR - FIXES APPLIED ===

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The Next.js client was receiving 400 Bad Request when attempting to log in
because there were NO USER ACCOUNTS in the Django database.

ROOT CAUSE:
1. Database was empty (0 users)
2. When trying to authenticate, Django correctly rejected the request
3. Error message: "Unable to log in with provided credentials"

FIXES APPLIED:

1. Fixed server\server\settings.py (Unicode Emoji Issue)
   - Line 522: Changed "✅" to "[OK]"
   - Line 540: Changed "🔧" to "[*]"
   - Line 542: Changed "⚠️" to "[!]"
   - Line 518: Changed "⚠️" to "[!]"
   - Line 561: Changed "⚠️" to "[!]"
   Reason: Windows Console uses CP1252 encoding, which doesn't support emoji

2. Created Test Users in Database
   - Client: test@example.com / TestPassword123! (role: client)
   - Admin: admin@example.com / AdminPassword123! (role: admin)
   Reason: Without test users, no one could log in

VERIFICATION:
✓ Users created successfully
✓ Both users authenticate correctly with Django
✓ Server settings fixed and Django management commands work
✓ API endpoint structure verified as correct
✓ CORS configuration verified as correct
✓ Serializers verified as correct

NEXT STEPS:
1. Start Django server: python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
2. Start Next.js client: npm run dev (in client folder)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
4. Test login with provided credentials
5. Should redirect to dashboard on success
